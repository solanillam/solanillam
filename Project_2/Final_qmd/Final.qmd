# Introduction

The oil and gas industry operates in a complex and high-stakes environment, where workforce dynamics and safety are critical to operational success. This project examines two years of data from **January 2022-- December 2023** derived from an oil refinery, focusing on employee work hours, overtime, and reported safety incidents. By cleaning and analyzing the data, this study aims to uncover meaningful patterns and trends that shed light on the relationship between workload and safety outcomes. Using visualizations to present the findings, the project provides a clear and concise overview of the data, offering insights to guide future discussions on workforce management and safety strategies.

Time to get started!

```{r}
#| label: "setup"
#| include: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, comment = NA, fig.align = "center")
```

## Loading Necessary Packages

```{r}
#| label: "needed"

# For data importing
library(readxl)

# For data manipulation and tidying
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)

# For date and time handling
library(lubridate)

# Quarto rendering
library(rmarkdown)  
library(knitr)      

# For creating visuals
library(ggplot2)

```

## Importing Data

The dataset for this project was sourced from an [Excel file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11NnYb1Ubl1xM4rzHecbwei9GDXQHKv-5/edit?gid=660108890#gid=660108890) and imported into R using the read_excel() function from the readxl package. The imported data was then inspected and prepared for analysis through a series of cleaning and transformation steps to ensure accuracy and usability.

```{r}
df <- read_excel("~/git_repos/solanillam/Project_2/Raw_Data/Copy of df_overall_final_V1.xlsx")
```

Ok, let's take a look at the data set.

## Data Munging (cleaning)

### Step 1: Data Reduction

```{r}
# Removed Unnecessary Columns
df_cleaned <- df %>% select(-aud, -obs, -turnaround)

# Removed Duplicate Rows
df_cleaned <- df_cleaned %>% distinct()
```

During the data reduction step, unnecessary columns (`aud`, `obs`, and `turnaround`) were removed to streamline the dataset and focus on relevant variables. Duplicate rows were eliminated to ensure the data was clean and free from redundancies, providing a solid foundation for accurate analysis.

### Step 2: Data Validation

```{r}
# Filtered Rows with Valid Values
df_cleaned <- df_cleaned %>%
  filter(!is.na(inc) & inc != 0) %>%
  filter(!is.na(ovt))
# Handled Outliers
df_cleaned <- df_cleaned %>%
  filter(ovt >= 0 & ovt <= 24)
```

Invalid rows with missing or zero incident values (`inc`) or missing overtime (`ovt`) were filtered out to ensure the dataset contained only meaningful observations. Outliers in overtime were handled by keeping only realistic values between 0 and 24 hours, maintaining the integrity of the data.

### Step 3: Data Transformation

```{r}
# Standardized Text Data
df_cleaned$unit <- trimws(toupper(df_cleaned$unit))

# Created New Variables
df_cleaned <- df_cleaned %>%
  mutate(total_work_time = hrs + ovt)
```

Text data in the `unit` column was standardized by trimming spaces and converting to uppercase for consistency. A new variable, `total_work_time`, was created to combine regular hours and overtime, enabling deeper analysis of workload patterns.

## Findings and Results

### Incident Trends Over Time

```{r}
#| label: fig-nbs
#| fig-cap: "Line graph showing fluctuations in the number of incidents over time, with the highest spike occurring in early 2024."
#| echo: false
# Incidents over time
df_incidents_over_time <- df_cleaned %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(total_incidents = sum(inc, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(df_incidents_over_time, aes(x = date, y = total_incidents)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Incidents Over Time", x = "Date", y = "Total Incidents") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 55, hjust = 1, vjust = 1.0, size = 8),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove major grid lines
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()  # Remove minor grid lines
  )
```

### Workload Trends Over Time

```{r}
#| label: fig-nbs1
#| fig-cap: "Line graph showing variations in total work time over time, with most values ranging between 50 and 150 hours, peaking occasionally throughout 2022 to early 2024."
#| echo: false
# Time-Based Trend: Total Work Time Over Time
# Plot total work time over time
ggplot(df_cleaned, aes(x = date, y = total_work_time)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Total Work Time Over Time", x = "Date", y = "Total Work Time (hrs)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Incident Distribution Across Units

```{r}
#| label: fig-nbs2
#| fig-cap: "Bar graph showing the distribution of incidents across refinery units, with GBR-OMCC-FIELD reporting the highest number of incidents."
#| echo: false
# Incident Distribution Across Units
# Bar plot of incidents across units
ggplot(df_cleaned, aes(x = unit, y = inc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Incidents Across Units", x = "Unit", y = "Number of Incidents") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 55, hjust = 1, vjust = 1.0, size = 8),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), # Remove major grid lines
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()  # Remove minor grid lines
  )
```

### Workload Variability by Unit

```{r}
#| label: fig-nbs3
#| fig-cap: "Bar graph showing average total work time across units, with the highest averages recorded in GBR-OMCC-FIELD and GBR-CHEMICALS units."
#| echo: false
# Average total work time by unit
df_avg_work_time <- df_cleaned %>%
  group_by(unit) %>%
  summarize(avg_work_time = mean(total_work_time, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(df_avg_work_time, aes(x = reorder(unit, avg_work_time), y = avg_work_time)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "coral") +
  labs(title = "Average Total Work Time by Unit", x = "Unit", y = "Average Work Time (hrs)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 55, hjust = 1, vjust = 1, size = 8), # Ensures angled text
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```

### Relationship Between Hours Worked and Overtime

```{r}
#| label: fig-nbs4
#| fig-cap: "Scatter plot showing the relationship between hours worked and overtime, with a positive correlation evident as higher regular hours often coincide with higher overtime."
#| echo: false
# Overtime vs. Hours Worked
# Scatter plot: Overtime vs. Hours Worked
ggplot(df_cleaned, aes(x = hrs, y = ovt)) +
  geom_point(color = "green", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Overtime vs. Hours Worked", x = "Hours Worked", y = "Overtime (hrs)") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Discussion
The analysis of two years of workforce and safety data from the oil refinery highlights several critical insights. Incident trends over time reveal significant spikes, particularly in early 2024, which may correlate with operational changes or increased workloads. Similarly, workload patterns exhibit variations across units, with departments such as GBR-OMCC-FIELD and GBR-CHEMICALS consistently recording higher total work hours. The positive correlation between hours worked and overtime suggests that employees in high-demand units might face a greater risk of fatigue, which could contribute to safety incidents. These findings underline the need for further investigation to identify the root causes of these trends and emphasize the importance of balancing workload distribution while implementing proactive safety measures to ensure both workforce well-being and operational efficiency.
