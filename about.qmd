Hello! I'm Mariana Solanilla, a passionate and driven individual who is excited to transition from my academic journey into the professional world. I’m graduating this December with a major in Psychology and a concentration in Human Services and a minor in Leadership Studies. Throughout my studies, I’ve developed a strong interest in understanding how people thrive in organizational settings and how effective leadership can foster a productive and inclusive environment.

Over the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience in human resources, safety analytics, and leadership, which has provided me with a broad set of skills that I’m eager to apply in a full-time role. I’ve worked on projects ranging from HR consulting to research on workplace safety, and I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse teams in both academic and professional settings.

I’m a first-generation college student with a deep commitment to personal growth, inclusivity, and fostering positive relationships both at work and in my personal life. I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned and continue growing as a professional in the workforce.

In my free time, I enjoy engaging in outdoor activities, photography, and reading to unwind and stay inspired. I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and contributing to an organization that values collaboration and innovation.



**My Journey in STT 2860**

As someone who has always been more drawn to people-oriented fields like psychology and leadership, diving into a course on data management and visualization felt like a bold step. But I’ve discovered just how powerful data can be in telling stories, identifying patterns, and supporting decision-making. This class has taught me to:

- Approach challenges with a growth mindset.
- See the beauty and creativity in data visualization.
- Translate complex information into accessible insights.

Through perseverance and curiosity, I’ve gained a stronger foundation in data analysis, and I’m excited to carry these skills into my future endeavors.
