    "text": "The oil and gas industry operates in a complex and high-stakes environment, where workforce dynamics and safety are critical to operational success. This project examines two years of data from January 2022– December 2023 derived from an oil refinery, focusing on employee work hours, overtime, and reported safety incidents. By cleaning and analyzing the data, this study aims to uncover meaningful patterns and trends that shed light on the relationship between workload and safety outcomes. Using visualizations to present the findings, the project provides a clear and concise overview of the data, offering insights to guide future discussions on workforce management and safety strategies.\nTime to get started!\n\n\n\n# For data importing\nlibrary(readxl)\n\n# For data manipulation and tidying\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n# For date and time handling\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# Quarto rendering\nlibrary(rmarkdown)  \nlibrary(knitr)      \n\n# For creating visuals\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\nThe dataset for this project was sourced from an Excel file and imported into R using the read_excel() function from the readxl package.

Incident trends over time reveal significant spikes, particularly in early 2024, which may correlate with operational changes or increased workloads. Similarly, workload patterns exhibit variations across units, with departments such as GBR-OMCC-FIELD and GBR-CHEMICALS consistently recording higher total work hours. The positive correlation between hours worked and overtime suggests that employees in high-demand units might face a greater risk of fatigue, which could contribute to safety incidents. These findings underline the need for further investigation to identify the root causes of these trends and emphasize the importance of balancing workload distribution while implementing proactive safety measures to ensure both workforce well-being and operational efficiency."
