I’m graduating this December with a major in Psychology and a concentration in Human Services and a minor in Leadership Studies. Throughout my studies, I’ve developed a strong interest in understanding how people thrive in organizational settings and how effective leadership can foster a productive and inclusive environment.\n\nOver the years, I’ve gained hands-on experience in human resources, safety analytics, and leadership, which has provided me with a broad set of skills that I’m eager to apply in a full-time role. I’ve worked on projects ranging from HR consulting to research on workplace safety, and I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with diverse teams in both academic and professional settings.\n\nI’m a first-generation college student with a deep commitment to personal growth, inclusivity, and fostering positive relationships both at work and in my personal life. I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned and continue growing as a professional in the workforce.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy engaging in outdoor activities, photography, and reading to unwind and stay inspired. I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals and contributing to an organization that values collaboration and innovation.\n\n\nhttps://stt2860-f2024.github.io/bicycle-sharing-solanillam/BikeSharing.html \n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](about_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
