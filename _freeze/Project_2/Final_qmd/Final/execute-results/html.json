This project examines two years of data (2022–2023) from an oil refinery, focusing on employee work hours, overtime, and reported safety incidents. By cleaning and analyzing the data, this study aims to uncover meaningful patterns and trends that shed light on the relationship between workload and safety outcomes. Using visualizations to present the findings, the project provides a clear and concise overview of the data, offering insights to guide future discussions on workforce management and safety strategies.\n\nTime to get started!\n\n\n\n\n\n## Loading Necessary Packages\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# For data importing\nlibrary(readxl)\n# For data manipulation and tidying\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\n# For date and time handling\nlibrary(lubridate)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Importing Data\n\nThe dataset for this project was sourced from an [Excel file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11NnYb1Ubl1xM4rzHecbwei9GDXQHKv-5/edit?gid=660108890#gid=660108890) and imported into R using the read_excel() function from the readxl package. The imported data was then inspected and prepared for analysis through a series of cleaning and transformation steps to ensure accuracy and usability.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- read_excel(\"~/git_repos/solanillam/Project_2/Raw_Data/Copy of df_overall_final_V1.xlsx\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nOk, let's take a look at the data set.\n\n### Data Structures and Variables",
